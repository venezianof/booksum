This error indicates a fundamental problem with launching the Chrome browser instance, which is typically an environmental configuration issue rather than a problem with the Python code itself.\n",

The root cause is most likely outside the scope of notebook-level code adjustments, possibly related to browser driver compatibility, system-level dependencies, or the Colab environment's specific setup for browser automation. Therefore, for tasks requiring web interaction, this environmental limitation will persist."

If your future tasks fall into this category, you can continue working here without issues.\n",

This would allow you to leverage web-based tools effectively."
