        "Per utilizzare l'agente di ricerca, segui questi passaggi:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Definisci i Termini di Ricerca**: Specifica le tue query per PubMed, i farmaci per i report FDA.\n",
        "2.  **Esegui la Ricerca**: L'agente recupererà le informazioni dalle fonti configurate.\n",
        "3.  **Visualizza i Risultati Formattati**: I risultati saranno presentati in un formato leggibile e riassunto.\n",
        "4.  **Salva il Report**: Potrai salvare il report completo in formato PDF e DOCX.\n",

        "\n",
        "Nel blocco di codice qui sotto, puoi modificare le variabili `pubmed_query`, `fda_drug_query` per eseguire una nuova ricerca. Per le linee guida mediche, continueremo a utilizzare il documento simulato, dato che l'accesso diretto ai siti delle società mediche si è rivelato problematico.\n",
        "\n",
        "Una volta eseguiti i blocchi di codice, verrà generato un report riassuntivo con le informazioni trovate."

        "1.  **PubMed**: This is a well-established database with a public API (E-utilities) that allows programmatic access to its content. We will focus on using this API for searching and retrieving article metadata.\n",

We will explore official FDA APIs (e.g., open.fda.gov) for structured data. If specific report documents (like adverse event reports or drug approval packages) are not readily available via API, we will investigate web scraping methods for targeted sections of the FDA website, adhering to their terms of service.\n",
        "3.  **Medical Society Guidelines**: Access to these guidelines can vary significantly. Some societies might offer APIs or structured data downloads, while others may only provide PDF documents on their websites. We will prioritize searching for official APIs or direct download links. If these are not available, web scraping will be considered, focusing on extracting text content from publicly accessible guideline documents, always respecting website policies.\n",

        "For each method, we will aim to establish an initial connection or retrieve a sample of data to confirm access."

        "\n",
        "To interact with E-utilities, we generally use the following workflow:\n",

        "\n",
        "No API key is strictly required for basic E-utilities usage, but providing an `api_key` parameter can improve performance and reliability by giving higher request limits. For this demonstration, we will proceed without an explicit API key, assuming basic usage limits are sufficient. However, for production systems, obtaining an API key is recommended.\n",

        "\n",
        "    *   **Official Website Identification**: For each society, we will first identify their official website where guidelines are typically published.\n",
        "    *   **API Check**: We will search for any publicly available APIs that might offer structured access to their guideline documents or summaries.\n",
        "    *   **Direct PDF/HTML Download**: If no API is found, we will look for direct links to PDF or HTML versions of the guidelines. Many societies provide these for public access.\n",
        "    *   **Ethical Web Scraping**: If direct downloads or APIs are not available, or if the information is embedded within web pages, we will consider ethical web scraping. This will involve using Python libraries such as `requests` to fetch web page content and `BeautifulSoup` for parsing HTML to extract relevant information. We will always adhere to the website's `robots.txt` file and terms of service, and prioritize publicly available, non-gated content. The aim will be to extract key sections of guidelines (e.g., recommendations, summary tables) rather than full documents if direct download is not feasible.\n",

            "  Summary Abstract: Osteosarcoma (OS) in pediatric, adolescent, and young adult (AYA) patients is an aggressive bone cancer with limited treatment options. Dysregulation of the CDK4/6-cyclin D axis and the PI3K/mTOR pathway contributes to OS pathogenesis, providing a biological rationale for co-targeting these signaling nodes. However, pharmacologic CDK4/6 inhibition can trigger compensatory activation of the PI3K/mTOR pathway, restoring D-type cyclin expression and partially reactivating CDK4/6 signaling.\n",

After having examined their original data, the authors have realized that this figure was assembled incorrectly; essentially, the wrong data were included in this figure to portray the GAPDH bands for the GH3 cell line.\n",

            "  Summary Abstract: Osteosarcoma (OS) in pediatric, adolescent, and young adult (AYA) patients is an aggressive bone cancer with limited treatment options. Dysregulation of the CDK4/6-cyclin D axis and the PI3K/mTOR pathway contributes to OS pathogenesis, providing a biological rationale for co-targeting these signaling nodes. However, pharmacologic CDK4/6 inhibition can trigger compensatory activation of the PI3K/mTOR pathway, restoring D-type cyclin expression and partially reactivating CDK4/6 signaling.\n",

After having examined their original data, the authors have realized that this figure was assembled incorrectly; essentially, the wrong data were included in this figure to portray the GAPDH bands for the GH3 cell line.\n",

            "  Summary Abstract: Muscarinic-cholinergic antagonists, such as atropine, are widely used to treat myopia, yet their mechanism of action remains unclear. Recent chick studies suggest atropine may act via a non-muscarinic pathway, specifically antagonism of serotonergic signalling. This study investigates the conservation of this mechanism across different models of myopia (form-deprivation myopia (FDM) and lens-induced myopia (LIM)), and across different muscarinic agents (i.e., pirenzepine).\n",

In primary HASM and human precision-cut lung slices (hPCLS) obtained from non-diseased donors, we show that the combination of umeclidinium (LAMA) and vilanterol (LABA) robustly attenuated carbachol-induced E-C coupling markers, compared to that induced by either compound individually. The effective concentrations of umeclidinium or vilanterol that attenuated E-C coupling signaling events were significantly decreased when the agents were combined as compared to dosing of either alone.\n",

In this study, the endothelial-smooth muscle signaling pathway involved in DK-mediated vasodilation was recapitulated using a multistep experimental system that integrates a co-culture of human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAEC) and human coronary artery Smooth Muscle Cells (HCASMC) with an in vivo zebrafish model. DK activated calcium-dependent signaling pathways in HCAEC, notably via muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M3 (AChM3R) and voltage-dependent calcium channels (VDCC), resulting in increased intracellular calcium levels and nitric oxide (NO) production.\n",

Biochemical studies were performed in frontal cortices, hippocampi and plasma samples from mice that were administered with MK-801 (schizophrenia-related dementa) or scopolamine (Alzheimer's disease model) for 14 days alone or together with muscarinic receptors modulators: VU0357017 (M Our results indicate that MK-801 or scopolamine disturb eNOS, DDAH1, PRMT5 expression, and L-arginine bioavailability. VU0357017 or VU0152100 prevented scopolamine or MK-801-induced eNOS dysfunction, but L-arginine derivatives synthesis was inhibited only in MK-801 model.\n",

We examined the effects of vericiguat on the open-loop dynamic characteristics of the carotid sinus baroreflex. In anesthetized Wistar-Kyoto rats (n = 8), sympathetic nerve activity (SNA), arterial pressure (AP), and aortic flow were measured while varying carotid sinus pressure (CSP) according to a Gaussian white noise signal with a mean of 120 mmHg and a standard deviation of 20 mmHg.\n",

        "The development of the medical and therapeutic research agent progressed through several key stages, successfully implementing core functionalities while also highlighting inherent challenges in accessing certain data sources:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Requirement Clarification**: The agent effectively initiated the process by generating a comprehensive set of questions to define the types of medical research, preferred data sources, desired output details, interaction modalities, and output formats required by medical professionals.\n",
        "*   **Successful API Integrations**: Direct programmatic access was successfully established for key data sources:\n",
        "    *   **PubMed**: The NCBI E-utilities API was used to search for articles, retrieve PMIDs, and fetch detailed records including titles, abstracts, authors, journals, and publication years. For example, a search for \"diabetes mellitus diagnosis\" successfully retrieved 5 PMIDs and their summaries.\n",
        "    *   **FDA Reports**: The `open.fda.gov` API was utilized to search for drug labels, extracting information such as brand name, generic name, manufacturer, indications, contraindications, and adverse reactions. A sample search for \"insulin\" successfully found drug labels.\n",
        "*   **Challenges with Medical Society Guidelines Access**: Persistent difficulties were encountered in programmatically accessing medical society guidelines from journal-affiliated websites.\n",
        "    *   Initial attempts to access pages from `ahajournals.org` and `diabetesjournals.org` (e.g., for AHA and ADA guidelines) resulted in `403 Client Error: Forbidden`, indicating robust anti-scraping measures and access controls.\n",
        "    *   Further attempts with the American Academy of Pediatrics' publication domain (`publications.aap.org`) yielded `404 Not Found` and `403 Forbidden` errors.\n",
        "    *   Due to these recurring restrictions, the strategy pivoted to *simulating* successful guideline acquisition for subsequent processing steps.\n",
        "*   **Core Information Extraction & Summarization**:\n",
        "    *   A generic text summarization function (`summarize_text`) was implemented, using NLTK's sentence tokenization, to extract concise summaries from longer texts.\n",
        "    *   A PDF text extraction function (`extract_text_from_pdf` using `PyPDF2`) was successfully implemented, allowing for content retrieval from pre-obtained guideline documents.\n",
        "*   **Professional Output Formatting**: Specialized functions were developed to format extracted data into a readable and useful structure for medical professionals, including:\n",
        "    *   Structured presentation of PubMed article details with summarized abstracts.\n",
        "    *   Formatted FDA drug label information with summarized indications and adverse reactions.\n",
        "    *   Overview summaries for medical guidelines.\n",
        "*   **Comprehensive Report Generation**: The agent demonstrated the ability to consolidate formatted information from all sources into a single comprehensive report. This report could then be saved to standard document formats, with `save_to_pdf` (using `reportlab`) and `save_to_docx` (using `python-docx`) functions successfully implemented and tested.\n",
        "*   **End-to-End Testing & Refinement**: An end-to-end test with a scenario involving \"diabetes mellitus treatment guidelines 2023\" for PubMed and \"metformin\" for FDA was successful. This test confirmed the agent's full workflow from data retrieval to report generation. During this test, NLTK dependencies were resolved, and observations were made regarding the need for potential improvements in FDA data parsing (e.g., avoiding irrelevant results like \"SILICEA\" when searching for \"metformin\") and PubMed result relevance.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Prioritize Access Strategy for Medical Guidelines**: Given the persistent `403 Forbidden` errors from journal-affiliated websites, future development should prioritize identifying medical society guidelines hosted on their primary organizational websites or truly open-access repositories. This might involve more sophisticated web crawling or direct liaison with societies for API access where available, rather than attempts to bypass publisher restrictions.\n",
        "*   **Refine Data Filtering and Parsing for API Sources**: The test phase revealed areas for improvement in data quality. For FDA drug labels, specific parsing logic is needed to ensure highly relevant results (e.g., precise drug matching). For PubMed, implementing advanced search logic or post-retrieval filtering based on article content could enhance the relevance of retrieved articles to the user's query.\n"
