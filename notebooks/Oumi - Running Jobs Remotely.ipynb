The simulated signal, representing 10 seconds of data at a sampling frequency of 250 Hz, had a shape of (2500,). This signal was constructed by combining P, QRS, and T waves, and augmented with Gaussian noise to simulate realistic ECG characteristics.\n",

We support various cloud providers (GCP, Runpod, Lambda) out of the box, with the additional flexibility to support your own custom cluster should the need arise! In this tutorial we will focus on running jobs using GCP, but this tutorial applies to all clouds Oumi supports.

The simulated signal, representing 10 seconds of data at a sampling frequency of 250 Hz, had a shape of (2500,). This signal was constructed by combining P, QRS, and T waves, and augmented with Gaussian noise to simulate realistic ECG characteristics.\n",
