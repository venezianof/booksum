        "- **SequentialAgent**: You'll learn to chain agents together, creating pipelines where the output of one agent becomes the input for the next.\n",

        "- **ParallelAgent**: You'll unleash efficiency by running multiple agents simultaneously and then synthesizing their collective findings into a single, comprehensive answer.\n",

        "This instruction guides the `router_agent` to classify incoming queries into one of the predefined categories, each corresponding to a specialist agent or a complex multi-agent workflow.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Multi-Agent Workflows and Their Purposes:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **`foodie_agent`**: Handles simple queries solely focused on finding a single food place. It uses `google_search` and saves its recommendation (restaurant name) to `state['destination']` for potential future use if part of a sequential workflow.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **`day_trip_agent`**: A general-purpose planner for simple day trip requests that don't involve complex constraints or multiple independent searches. It also uses `google_search`.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **`find_and_navigate_agent` (Sequential Workflow)**:\n",
        "    *   **Structure**: This is a `SequentialAgent` comprising `foodie_agent` followed by `transportation_agent`.\n",
        "    *   **Purpose**: Designed for queries that require *first finding a location* (e.g., a restaurant) and *then obtaining directions* to it. The `foodie_agent` identifies the destination and stores it in `state['destination']`. The `transportation_agent` then automatically uses this `destination` from the shared state to provide directions, demonstrating seamless data passing between agents in a sequence.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  **`iterative_planner_agent` (Loop Workflow)**:\n",
        "    *   **Structure**: This is a `SequentialAgent` that first runs `planner_agent` and then enters a `LoopAgent` called `refinement_loop` (which contains `critic_agent` and `refiner_agent`).\n",
        "    *   **Purpose**: Addresses queries that involve planning with specific constraints (e.g., short travel time between locations) that might require refinement. The `planner_agent` proposes an initial plan. The `refinement_loop` then iteratively checks this plan using the `critic_agent` (which might use `google_search` to check travel times) and refines it with the `refiner_agent` until the constraint is met or `max_iterations` is reached. The `refiner_agent` uses an `exit_loop` tool to terminate the loop when the plan is deemed feasible.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.  **`parallel_planner_agent` (Parallel Workflow)**:\n",
        "    *   **Structure**: This is a `SequentialAgent` that first runs `parallel_research_agent` (a `ParallelAgent`) and then `synthesis_agent`.\n",
        "    *   **Purpose**: Optimizes queries asking for *multiple independent things* simultaneously (e.g., a museum, a concert, and a restaurant). The `parallel_research_agent` concurrently executes `museum_finder_agent`, `concert_finder_agent`, and `restaurant_finder_agent`. Each specialist agent saves its result to a unique key in the shared state (e.g., `museum_result`, `concert_result`, `restaurant_result`). Once all parallel tasks are complete, the `synthesis_agent` collects these results from the shared state and compiles them into a unified summary for the user.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Delegation Prediction for Test Queries:\n",
        "\n",
        "Based on the router's instructions and the workflow descriptions, here's how the test queries in `run_fully_loaded_app` will be delegated:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Query**: \"Find me the best sushi in Palo Alto and then tell me how to get there from the Caltrain station.\"\n",
        "    *   **Prediction**: `find_and_navigate_agent`\n",
        "    *   **Reasoning**: This query explicitly asks to *first find a place* and *then get directions*, directly matching the `find_and_navigate_agent`'s description.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Query**: \"Plan me a day in San Francisco with a museum and a nice dinner, but make sure the travel time between them is very short.\"\n",
        "    *   **Prediction**: `iterative_planner_agent`\n",
        "    *   **Reasoning**: The inclusion of a specific constraint (\"make sure the travel time between them is very short\") that needs checking and potential refinement aligns perfectly with the `iterative_planner_agent`'s purpose.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Query**: \"Help me plan a trip to SF. I need one museum, one concert, and one great restaurant.\"\n",
        "    *   **Prediction**: `parallel_planner_agent`\n",
        "    *   **Reasoning**: This query requests *multiple, independent things* (museum, concert, restaurant) simultaneously, which is the exact scenario the `parallel_planner_agent` is designed to handle efficiently."
