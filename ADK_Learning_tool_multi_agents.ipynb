        "By the end of this session, you will be an expert in advanced agentic workflows:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **SequentialAgent**: You'll learn to chain agents together, creating pipelines where the output of one agent becomes the input for the next.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **LoopAgent**: You'll build iterative systems where agents can plan, critique, and refine their work until a specific goal is met, making them \"perfectionists.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "- **ParallelAgent**: You'll unleash efficiency by running multiple agents simultaneously and then synthesizing their collective findings into a single, comprehensive answer.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **The Router**: You will construct a \"master\" router agent that intelligently analyzes a user's request and delegates it to the correct agent or workflow.\n",

These were then correctly chained together into a `SequentialAgent` named `medical_workflow_agent`.\n",

This ensures that medical research and therapy-related requests are correctly delegated to the new workflow.\n",
        "*   **API Key Blockage:** Despite the successful implementation and integration of the medical multi-agent system, functional testing was incomplete. All attempts to run test cases for the `medical_workflow_agent` failed due to a persistent \"Missing key inputs argument!\" error, indicating that the Google API key was not properly configured in the execution environment.\n",
