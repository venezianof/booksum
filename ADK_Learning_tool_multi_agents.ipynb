        "By the end of this session, you will be an expert in advanced agentic workflows:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **SequentialAgent**: You'll learn to chain agents together, creating pipelines where the output of one agent becomes the input for the next.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **LoopAgent**: You'll build iterative systems where agents can plan, critique, and refine their work until a specific goal is met, making them \"perfectionists.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "- **ParallelAgent**: You'll unleash efficiency by running multiple agents simultaneously and then synthesizing their collective findings into a single, comprehensive answer.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **The Router**: You will construct a \"master\" router agent that intelligently analyzes a user's request and delegates it to the correct agent or workflow.\n",
